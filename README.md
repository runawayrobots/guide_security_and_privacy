## Kids on the internet

You can control what your kids have access to on the internet when they are in your house on your network.

It gets significantly more difficult to control when they are outside of your home network's control.

### Home internet filtering

[!NOTE]
This information below is biased for Comcast/Xfinity cable modems. The principles and overall design are applicable but there will be differences if you have DSL, fiberoptic, or Starlink internet providers.

(NextDNS)[nextdns.io] is a great service what provides easy filtering of the internet. They have broad filter categories that can be selected, including advertisments and malware, while also allowing you to explicityly to add sites to a deny list.

To enable filtering on your entire home network you will need to update the DNS configuration of your home internet router to point to the NextDNS servers.

Most internet routers make this a striaght forward process, just google the name of your router and "DNS" and you will find a help page that will walk you through it. Also just logging into your router and poking around to find DNS servers will also work.

Unfortunatley some routers that are leased from your internet provider **do not** allow you to update the DNS settings. This will require you to purchase additional hardware to be able to manage the DNS for your home network.

There are three options to get around this:

1. Purchase an interenet modem and a separate home network router to replace the hardware from your internet provider.
2. Purchase an all-in-one modem and router to replace the hardware from your internet provider.
3. Purchase a home network router and configure the hardware from your internet provider into "bridge mode".

[!IMPORTANT]
Unfortunaley not using your internet providers provided hardware may disable features provided by your internet provider, such as home security add-ons, since those features depend on the use of there all-in-one unit. If you are using additional services from your internet provider contact their support to check if using one of the options will break.

#### Modem + Router

This option eliminates the need for leasing your internet providers equipment which may lower your bill if they charge for it.

Buying two separate network components allows each item to be upgraded individually over time. Cable modem technology does not change much and that unit will only need to be replaced if it stops working, or your service is upgraded to mega-super-speed that requires a new modem to handle that speed. Wireless router technology makes advances every couple of years, so you can upgrade your wireless technology more frequently at a lower cost since modem+router components (next section) have a higher cost.

#### All-in-one Modem + Router

This option eliminates the need for leasing your internet providers equipment which may lower your bill if they charge for it.

#### Router + Bridge Mode

Some internet providers modem+router units may be set to be in a "bridge mode". This retains the internet modem funcationaltiy but turns of the home network router features.
